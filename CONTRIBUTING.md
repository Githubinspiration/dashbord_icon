# üéâ Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our icon repository! To ensure that everything runs smoothly, we've set out some guidelines for contributors.

## üåü Icon Specifications

- Each icon should be in `PNG` format and have a height of exactly `512px`. Width does not matter. ‚ùóÔ∏è(No upscales! If the correct size cannot be found, a smaller height will be accepted.)

- Each icon should include both a `PNG` and `SVG` version. If an `SVG` cannot be found, then only a `PNG` version is required.

- Icons should be named after their full name, with spaces replaced by dashes. For example, "Facebook Messenger" should be named `facebook-messenger.png`.

- Monochrome icons should default to a dark version. Light versions should be named `service-light.png`. If a light version is not available, use https://pinetools.com/colorize-image to change its color.

- If an `SVG` is available for an icon, the `PNG` should be a conversion of that `SVG`. Use https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png to do this. Set the height to `512px` and leave the width empty.
